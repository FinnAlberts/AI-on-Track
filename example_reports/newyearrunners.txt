On January 8, a number of Scopias athletes started the new year in a sporty way at various competitions. At the New Year's Run organized by Orion, a 5 and a 10 kilometer were on the program, in which various athletes participated. Also in Egmond aan Zee we see a number of runners at the Halve van Egmond and one athlete decided to run the NS trail.

On the double distance, both Anne Vink with 48.22 minutes and Marscha Scherjon with 51.28 minutes claimed second place, with Marscha being accompanied to the finish by Chantal Sanders. Among the men, Johan van Gageldonk rose above all peers with his victory in 42.45 minutes.

Dave van 't Hull started 2023 with a 10 km time of 50.03 minutes and Hans Faassen clocked 50.46 minutes. The recreational runners of Scopias were also present. Two of them, Harriët Groetelaars and Yvonne Janssen, even finished on the podium! Harriët was the well-deserved winner in the V60 category on the 5 km. Yvonne took second place in the V50 category on the 10 km.

Halve van Egmond
The Halve van Egmond has been organised in Egmond aan Zee since 2020. Almost 12,000 participants travelled to the coastal town for a sand-eating and wind diving competition for professionals. Margit Leipoldt completed a tough quarter marathon in 53.37 minutes. Then the starting shot was fired for the famous half marathon. Puck Huijs was the fastest to leave and reported back to the boulevard after 1 hour and 24.02 minutes. Guus Ummenthun only needed 1 hour and 26.42 minutes to complete the lap over the beach and through the dunes. Judith Heijnen completed this edition in 1 hour and 44.19 minutes.

NS Trail
Ruud Fortuin ran without a starting number this weekend and ran the NS Trail, as it is meant to be: from Venlo station to Roermond. He covered the distance of 35 km and 270 hm in 3 hours and 35 minutes.
