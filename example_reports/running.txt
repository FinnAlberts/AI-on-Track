Running weekend at home and abroad!
October 24, 2023
It is described as a paradise for runners, because of the mild climate, the beautiful surroundings and the flat course. Dominique van Eijk and Luke Heijnen went to Valencia for it and ran the half marathon there. Luke managed to complete it after 1.25.55 and Dominique was very satisfied with her 1.41.58.

Ton RÃ¼ckert was also abroad. Ton announced earlier this week that he would travel to Dresden. He finished 6th in the M65 category in a time of 1.54.03.

Roel Smedts looked a little closer to home and registered for the 10 km of the Pondorun in Kessel. He stopped the clock after 37.16 min, which brought him to the 3rd step of the podium. Also a number of younger athletes participated in this run, namely Ryan van Groenendaal, Indy van Groenendaal and Djes Nelissen. All three finished on the podium! Ryan and Indy finished first. Djes came third.
